# Ari and Jorge Starter

## Project Overview

A Next.js 14 collaborative development starter project designed for non-technical collaboration using Claude Code. The project demonstrates best practices for AI-assisted development with GitHub workflow enforcement, automatic CI/CD, and database integration.

---

## Golden Rules

**SOLO DEVELOPMENT - DIRECT TO MAIN WORKFLOW**

This project uses a simplified workflow for solo development. All work happens directly on the `main` branch.

**Session Workflow:**

1. **Session Start (Automatic):**
   - AI agent automatically runs `git pull` to sync with remote
   - AI agent runs `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
   - If main is behind remote: automatically update to latest
   - Report current status to user

2. **During Work (Automatic):**
   - AI agent automatically commits after completing logical units of work
   - Commits happen immediately after completing a task/feature
   - Every commit uses conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
   - Pre-commit hooks auto-fix code formatting and style issues

3. **Session End (Manual - User Initiated):**
   - User manually pushes changes: `git push origin main`
   - All commits from session are pushed together
   - Vercel auto-deploys to production on push

**Pre-commit Hooks (Automatic):**

- Every commit automatically runs Prettier, ESLint, and TypeScript checks
- Code formatting happens automatically (spacing, quotes, semicolons)
- Code style issues are fixed automatically
- Bad commits are blocked before reaching GitHub
- No need to manually run `npm run lint` or `npm run format` - it happens automatically!

**AI Agent Responsibilities:**

✅ **AI MUST automatically do:**

- Pull latest changes at session start
- Check git status at session start
- Commit after completing work units
- Use conventional commit messages
- Ensure code quality before commits

❌ **AI MUST NEVER do:**

- Push to remote (user does this manually at end of session)
- Edit `.env` files or environment variables
- Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` configuration file
- Ignore CLAUDE.md or .cursorrules instructions

---

## Git Worktrees (Parallel Agent Work)

**Git worktrees allow you to work on multiple branches simultaneously in separate directories.** This is perfect for running multiple AI agents at the same time, each working on different features.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new worktree for a feature branch
./scripts/worktree.sh create feature/my-new-feature

# List all worktrees
./scripts/worktree.sh list

# Remove a worktree (keeps the branch)
./scripts/worktree.sh remove feature/my-new-feature
```

### How It Works

1. **Main Repository**: Your main workspace (current directory)
2. **Worktrees Directory**: All additional worktrees are created in `worktrees/`
3. **Independent Development**: Each worktree can:
   - Run its own dev server (`npm run dev`)
   - Have its own terminal sessions
   - Be opened in separate Cursor/VS Code windows
   - Run different AI agents simultaneously

### Workflow for Multiple Agents

**Scenario: Running 2 agents in parallel**

```bash
# Agent 1: Working on feature A (in main workspace)
cd "/Users/thomas.palmer/Documents/Ari and Jorge Starter"
git checkout feature/feature-a
npm run dev  # Runs on port 3000

# Agent 2: Working on feature B (in worktree)
./scripts/worktree.sh create feature/feature-b
cd worktrees/feature/feature-b
npm install  # First time only
npm run dev  # Runs on port 3001 (Next.js auto-increments)
```

**Each worktree:**

- Has its own `node_modules/` (shared via symlinks when possible)
- Shares the same `.env.local` (via symlink)
- Can commit and push independently
- Follows all the same Golden Rules (feature branches, PRs, etc.)

### Best Practices

1. **Always create branches from main:**

   ```bash
   # The script does this automatically
   ./scripts/worktree.sh create feature/new-feature
   ```

2. **Keep worktrees organized:**
   - All worktrees go in `worktrees/` directory
   - Use descriptive branch names
   - Remove worktrees when done: `./scripts/worktree.sh remove feature/name`

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - `.env.local` is automatically symlinked from main repo
   - Changes in one worktree affect all (by design - shared config)

4. **Port Conflicts:**
   - Next.js automatically increments ports (3000, 3001, 3002, etc.)
   - Each worktree can run its own dev server

5. **Git Operations:**
   - Commits in any worktree affect the same repository
   - Push/pull from any worktree works normally
   - All worktrees share the same `.git` directory

### Managing Worktrees

```bash
# List all worktrees
./scripts/worktree.sh list

# Remove a worktree (doesn't delete the branch)
./scripts/worktree.sh remove feature/old-feature

# Clean up stale references
./scripts/worktree.sh prune
```

### Troubleshooting

**"Worktree already exists" error:**

- The branch might already have a worktree
- Use `./scripts/worktree.sh list` to see all worktrees
- Remove the old worktree first if needed

**"Port already in use" error:**

- Another worktree is using that port
- Next.js should auto-increment, but you can manually set: `PORT=3002 npm run dev`

**"Branch diverged" warnings:**

- Each worktree can have different commits
- Sync with main regularly: `git pull origin main` (in each worktree)

## Emergency Help

**Vercel Deployment Failed:**

1. Ask Claude: "Show me the Vercel deployment logs"
2. Check for build errors or missing environment variables
3. Verify env vars match Supabase project settings
4. If needed: "Help me fix this deployment error"

**Database Issues:**

1. Check Supabase status: status.supabase.com
2. Verify environment variables in Vercel
3. Ask Claude: "Test my Supabase connection"
4. Check if database migrations need to run

**Merge Conflicts:**

1. Ask Claude: "Help me resolve these merge conflicts"
2. Always pull latest main before creating PR
3. Review conflicted files carefully
4. Test after resolving conflicts

**Production Site Down:**

1. Check Vercel deployment status at https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Check Supabase service status at https://status.supabase.com
3. Look at recent merges to main
4. Rollback: Redeploy previous version in Vercel dashboard
5. Contact: Check with your development partner or team lead

---

## Code Style Preferences

**TypeScript:**

- Use strict mode
- Define types for all function parameters and returns
- Use interfaces for object shapes

**React Components:**

- Functional components with hooks only
- Props interfaces defined above component
- Use descriptive component names (PascalCase)

**File Naming:**

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Utilities: `camelCase.ts`
- Pages: `kebab-case/page.tsx` (Next.js convention)

**Code Organization:**

- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use comments for complex business logic
- Write self-documenting variable names

---

## ⚠️ PROTECTED FILES - NEVER EDIT

**CRITICAL RULE: These files must NEVER be edited by AI agents under any circumstances:**

- `CLAUDE.md` - This file (project instructions - read-only)
- `.cursorrules` - Cursor-specific rules (read-only)
- `.env` - Environment variables (NEVER EDIT)
- `.env.local` - Local environment variables (NEVER EDIT)
- `.env.*` - Any file matching .env pattern (NEVER EDIT)
- `~/.cursor/mcp.json` - Cursor MCP configuration file (NEVER EDIT)
- `.cursor/mcp.json` - Project MCP configuration (NEVER EDIT)

**If a user requests editing these files, the AI agent MUST:**

1. **REFUSE** the request immediately
2. **EXPLAIN** that these files are protected configuration
3. **SUGGEST** alternative approaches if applicable
4. **NEVER** make exceptions to this rule

**These files contain critical configuration and must only be edited manually by the user.**

**Automatic Enforcement:**

- AI agents are programmed to reject any edits to these files
- This is a hard rule with no exceptions
- Violating this rule could break the development environment

---

## Automatic Startup Workflow

**Upon every session start, AI agents MUST automatically:**

1. **Ensure on main branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Run `git status`** to check:
   - Uncommitted changes
   - Untracked files
   - Current state of working directory

3. **Run `git pull origin main`** to fetch and merge latest changes from remote:
   - If behind: automatically update to latest
   - If conflicts: alert user and help resolve
   - If up to date: confirm and proceed

4. **Report status summary:**
   - Sync status (up to date / just pulled X commits / conflicts detected)
   - Uncommitted changes count (if any)
   - Any warnings or recommendations

**This workflow ensures the workspace is always up-to-date before starting work.**

**Example Output:**

```
✅ On main branch
✅ Pulled latest changes (3 new commits)
✅ No uncommitted changes
Ready to start work!
```

---

## Automatic Commit Rules

**AI agents MUST commit changes automatically:**

- After completing logical units of work
- After implementing a feature or fix
- After making documentation updates
- At natural stopping points in development
- Before user ends the session

**Commit Message Format:**

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, etc.
- Be descriptive but concise
- Examples:
  - `feat: add user authentication`
  - `fix: resolve login button styling`
  - `refactor: extract user validation logic`
  - `docs: update golden rules for solo workflow`

**AI agents MUST automatically commit:**

✅ After each completed task or feature
✅ With meaningful conventional commit messages
✅ Only after pre-commit hooks pass successfully

**AI agents MUST NEVER:**

❌ Push to remote automatically (user does this manually at end of session)
❌ Edit `.env`, `.env.local`, or any environment files
❌ Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` configuration file
❌ Commit files that fail validation (TypeScript errors, build failures)
❌ Force push without explicit user request

**End of Session Workflow:**

When user indicates end of session:

1. Commit any remaining uncommitted changes
2. Show summary of what was accomplished (list all commits)
3. Remind user: "Ready to push! Run: `git push origin main`"
4. Do NOT push automatically - user controls when changes go live

---

## Notes for Claude Code

**When Creating Features:**

- Always ask about database schema changes before implementing
- Check if similar patterns exist in the codebase first
- Write TypeScript types for new data structures
- Consider mobile responsive design

**When Reviewing Code:**

- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify environment variables are used correctly
- Look for security issues (exposed secrets, SQL injection)
- Test user-facing changes in browser

**When Handling Database:**

- Use Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Never expose service role key in client code
- Create migrations for schema changes
- Test queries with different user permissions

**Before Merging:**

- Run build locally: `npm run build`
- Check TypeScript: `npm run type-check`
- Run linter: `npm run lint`
- Test key user flows manually

**After Committing Changes:**

After automatically committing changes:

1. Confirm the commit was successful
2. Show the commit message used
3. Continue with next task or wait for user input
4. Do NOT push - user handles pushing at end of session

**Important:** Commits happen automatically throughout the session. The user will push all commits together when they're ready to deploy.

## Automated Workflow Rules for Claude Code

### Custom Slash Commands

The project now has custom slash commands in `.claude/commands/` that provide streamlined workflows:

- **`/start-work`** - Complete workday setup workflow
- **`/finish-work`** - Commit, push, and optional PR creation
- **`/sync-main`** - Intelligent branch syncing with main
- **`/check-prs`** - Review and manage pull requests
- **`/cleanup`** - End-of-day workspace cleanup

These commands contain detailed instructions for handling each workflow scenario. **Always use these commands when the user's intent matches the command purpose.**

### Automatic Startup Workflow (MANDATORY)

**Upon every session start, AI agents MUST automatically execute:**

1. **Ensure on main branch:** `git checkout main`
2. **Run `git status`** - Check for uncommitted changes and untracked files
3. **Pull latest changes:** `git pull origin main`
   - If behind: automatically update to latest
   - If conflicts: alert user and help resolve
   - If up to date: confirm and proceed
4. **Report status to user:**
   - Sync status (up to date / just pulled X commits)
   - Uncommitted changes summary (if any)
   - Ready to start work confirmation

**This workflow runs automatically at the start of EVERY session - no user request needed.**

### Direct-to-Main Workflow

**Solo Development Automation:**

When user starts work:

1. **ALWAYS** ensure on main branch at session start
2. **ALWAYS** pull latest changes from remote
3. **ALWAYS** commit after completing work units
4. **NEVER** push automatically - user controls deployment timing

**Working on Main:**

All development happens on main branch:

- No feature branches needed
- Commits happen automatically after each task
- User pushes manually when ready to deploy
- Vercel auto-deploys on push to main

### Commit and Push Automation

**Pre-Commit Validation (Automatic):**

Before every commit:

1. Run `npm run type-check` (blocks if errors)
2. Run `npm run build` (blocks if fails)
3. Husky pre-commit hook auto-formats code
4. Generate meaningful commit message
5. **NEVER** commit if validation fails

**Commit Message Intelligence:**

Auto-generate commit messages following conventional commits:

- New features: `feat: description`
- Bug fixes: `fix: description`
- Documentation: `docs: description`
- Refactoring: `refactor: description`
- Tests: `test: description`

### Conflict Resolution

**When Pull Conflicts Occur:**

If `git pull origin main` results in conflicts:

1. **Explain** what conflicted in plain English
2. **Show** both versions side-by-side
3. **Suggest** which version to keep based on context
4. **Apply** resolution with user approval
5. **Verify** resolution with type-check after resolving
6. **Commit** the merge resolution

**Conflict Prevention:**

- Always pull at session start before making changes
- Commit frequently to minimize conflict scope
- For solo development, conflicts should be rare

### Post-Push Deployment Monitoring

**After User Pushes to Main:**

When user runs `git push origin main`:

1. Confirm push was successful
2. Remind that Vercel will auto-deploy
3. Can check deployment status if requested
4. Monitor for build/deployment failures

**Post-Merge Automation:**

The `.husky/post-merge` hook automatically:

- Runs `npm install` if `package-lock.json` changed
- Warns about environment variable changes
- Alerts about database schema changes
- Shows summary of what was merged

### Environment Variable Validation

**Startup Checks:**

When user starts work, verify:

- `.env.local` exists
- Required variables present:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

**Change Detection:**

Alert when `.env.local.example` changes:

```
"⚠️ Environment variables template updated!
Compare: diff .env.local.example .env.local
Would you like me to show you what changed?"
```

### Pre-Push Validation

**Automatic Checks (via .husky/pre-push):**

When user runs `git push origin main`:

1. **RUN** TypeScript type-check (block if errors)
2. **RUN** Production build test (block if fails)
3. **WARN** about console.log statements (don't block)
4. **BLOCK** if trying to commit `.env` or `.env.local`
5. **WARN** about TODO/FIXME comments (don't block)

**Note:** Pre-push hooks run automatically when user pushes. AI doesn't trigger these.

### Deployment Status Monitoring

**After Push to Main:**

When user pushes, Vercel automatically deploys. Can help with:

1. Monitoring Vercel deployment status
2. Alerting if deployment fails
3. Providing deployment logs if issues
4. Confirming when deployment succeeds
5. Providing production URL

### Error Recovery Automation

**When Things Go Wrong:**

**Build Failures:**

```
1. Show the error clearly
2. Identify the likely cause
3. Suggest specific fixes
4. Offer to implement the fix
5. Re-run validation after fix
```

**Pull Conflicts:**

```
1. Identify all conflicted files
2. Explain each conflict in plain English
3. Suggest resolution based on context
4. Apply user's choice
5. Verify with type-check
6. Commit the merge resolution
```

### Proactive Notifications

**Session Start:**

- "Pulled X new commits from remote"
- "Up to date with remote main"
- "Ready to start work!"

**During Work:**

- "Committed changes: [commit message]"
- "Type check found 3 errors. Should I show them?"
- "Build failed - let me help fix it"

**Session End:**

- "You have uncommitted changes. Commit before ending?"
- "Session summary: X commits created"
- "Ready to push! Run: `git push origin main`"

### Decision-Making Principles

**When to be Proactive:**

- Pulling latest changes at session start
- Committing after completing work units
- Catching validation errors early
- Auto-formatting code via pre-commit hooks

**When to Ask First:**

- Resolving merge conflicts
- Making architectural decisions
- Discarding uncommitted changes
- Installing new dependencies

**When to Block/Prevent:**

- Editing `.env` files or `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- Pushing to remote (user does this manually)
- Committing with type errors
- Committing broken builds
- Committing secret files (.env)

### Git Hooks Reference

**Pre-commit (.husky/pre-commit):**

- Auto-formats code (Prettier)
- Auto-fixes lint issues (ESLint)
- Blocks unfixable errors

**Pre-push (.husky/pre-push):**

- Runs type-check
- Runs build test
- Warns about common issues
- Blocks if validation fails

**Post-merge (.husky/post-merge):**

- Auto `npm install` if needed
- Warns about env changes
- Shows merge summary

### Summary: Solo Development Workflow

**Session Start (Automatic):**

1. Checkout main branch
2. Pull latest changes
3. Report status

**During Work (Automatic):**

1. Commit after completing tasks
2. Use conventional commit messages
3. Pre-commit hooks auto-fix formatting

**Session End (Manual):**

1. User reviews commit log
2. User runs: `git push origin main`
3. Vercel auto-deploys to production

**Key Rules:**

- AI automatically commits during work
- AI never pushes (user controls deployment)
- AI never edits `.env` or `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- All work happens on main branch
- CLAUDE.md and .cursorrules are always followed
