# Project Handoff Summary

## Overview

This Next.js 14 starter project is now fully configured for **non-technical collaboration** using **Claude Code in Cursor IDE**. Your CEO and COO can work on this project using natural language commands through AI assistance.

---

## What's Been Set Up

### ✅ Core Project Structure
- **Next.js 14** with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Supabase** integration (PostgreSQL database, auth)
- **Vercel** deployment (auto-deploys from `main` branch)
- Complete project file structure (app/, components/, lib/, types/)

### ✅ GitHub Repository
- **Repo:** https://github.com/tcpalm-r/ari-jorge-collab
- **Branch protection:** Needs to be enabled manually (requires GitHub Pro for private repos)
- All code committed and pushed

### ✅ MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration
Three MCP servers configured for natural language interaction:

1. **GitHub MCP** (Remote)
   - Manage pull requests, branches, issues
   - Commands: "Show me all open PRs", "Create a new branch"

2. **Supabase MCP** (Remote)
   - Query database, check schema, manage data
   - Commands: "Show database schema", "Query users table"

3. **Vercel MCP** (Local)
   - Check deployments, view logs, manage projects
   - Commands: "What's the deployment status?", "Show recent logs"

### ✅ Documentation Created
- **README.md** - Quick start guide with MCP setup
- **CLAUDE.md** - Complete workflow guidelines (needs customization)
- **MCP_SETUP.md** - Detailed MCP configuration guide
- **setup-mcp.sh** - Automated setup script

---

## What Your Team Needs to Do

### For Each Team Member (5-10 minutes):

1. **Install Prerequisites:**
   - Cursor IDE
   - Node.js 18+
   - Git

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tcpalm-r/ari-jorge-collab.git
   cd ari-jorge-collab
   ```

3. **Run MCP Setup:**
   ```bash
   ./setup-mcp.sh
   ```
   They'll need three API tokens (instructions provided in script)

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add Supabase credentials (share these securely!)

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. **Test It:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000

7. **Restart Cursor** to activate MCP servers

---

## What You Still Need to Configure

### 1. Customize Documentation
Update these placeholder sections:

**In `README.md`:**
- Production URL (once Vercel finishes deploying)

**In `CLAUDE.md`:**
- Line 1: Replace `[Project Name]` with actual project name
- Line 5: Add project description and business purpose
- Line 181-186: Add emergency contact information
- Update any other `[placeholders]`

### 2. Share API Tokens Securely
Your CEO/COO will need:
- GitHub Personal Access Token
- Supabase Project Reference ID: `kjfizpagyleefuucsdbu`
- Vercel API Token

Share the Supabase `.env.local` credentials:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

**Use a password manager or encrypted channel** (never email/Slack!)

### 3. GitHub Branch Protection ✅ CONFIGURED

**Status:** Fully enforced (repository is public)

Branch protection rules are active for `main`:
- ✅ **Direct pushes blocked** - Must use Pull Requests
- ✅ **1 approval required** - Another team member must review
- ✅ **CI must pass** - All GitHub Actions checks must be green
- ✅ **Enforced for admins** - Even administrators cannot bypass
- ✅ **No force pushes** - History cannot be rewritten
- ✅ **No deletion** - Main branch cannot be deleted

**What this means:** Your CEO/COO physically CANNOT push directly to main, even by accident. They must create feature branches and PRs. This prevents all common beginner mistakes.

### 4. Add Team Members
- GitHub: Add as collaborators with write access
- Vercel: Add to project (optional - only if they need dashboard access)
- Supabase: Add to project (optional - they can use MCP instead)

## How They'll Work with Claude Code

### Example Workflow:

**Starting a new feature:**
```
User: "I want to add a contact form to the homepage"

Claude: "I'll help you create a contact form. Let me first create a
new branch for this feature."
[Creates branch via GitHub MCP]

Claude: "Now let's create the form component..."
[Writes the code]

Claude: "Done! Would you like me to commit these changes and create a PR?"

User: "Yes"

Claude: [Commits via git, creates PR via GitHub MCP]
"PR created! Ask your teammate to review it."
```

**Checking deployment:**
```
User: "Is the site deployed yet?"

Claude: [Checks via Vercel MCP]
"Yes! Your latest deployment finished 2 minutes ago.
Status: Ready. URL: https://your-app.vercel.app"
```

**Database query:**
```
User: "How many users do we have?"

Claude: [Queries via Supabase MCP]
"You currently have 12 users in the database."
```

## Teaching Them the Workflow

### Golden Rule
**Never commit directly to `main` branch**

### Correct Workflow:
1. **Start:** "Create a new feature branch for [feature name]"
2. **Work:** Make changes, ask Claude to implement features
3. **Commit:** "Commit these changes with a descriptive message"
4. **PR:** "Create a pull request for this feature"
5. **Review:** The other person reviews and approves
6. **Merge:** "Merge this approved PR"
7. **Repeat:** "Pull the latest changes from main"

### Key Commands They Should Know:

**Git/GitHub:**
- "Create a new branch called feature/my-feature"
- "Show me what files I've changed"
- "Commit these changes"
- "Create a PR for this work"
- "Show me all open PRs"
- "Pull the latest changes from main"

**Vercel:**
- "Check deployment status"
- "Show me deployment logs"
- "What's the production URL?"

**Supabase:**
- "Show me the database schema"
- "Query the users table"
- "Check if authentication is configured"

**Development:**
- "Start the development server"
- "Run type checks"
- "Build the project"

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP not working"
1. Check `.cursor/.env.mcp` exists with their tokens
2. Restart Cursor completely
3. Verify API tokens are valid

### "Can't push to GitHub"
- Make sure they're added as collaborators
- Check they've authenticated git (Cursor may prompt)

### "Deployment failed"
- Check Vercel environment variables match Supabase
- View logs: "Show me the Vercel deployment logs"

## Success Metrics

Your CEO/COO should be able to:
- ✅ Create a new feature branch
- ✅ Ask Claude to implement a simple feature
- ✅ Commit and push changes
- ✅ Create a pull request
- ✅ Review each other's PRs
- ✅ Check deployment status
- ✅ Query the database

**All using natural language in Claude Code!**

## Next Steps

1. **Finish Vercel deployment** and update README with production URL
2. **Customize CLAUDE.md** with actual project details
3. **Share credentials** securely with your team
4. **Schedule a walkthrough** where you demonstrate the workflow
5. **Have them practice** with a simple task (like adding their name to the homepage)
6. **Set up regular check-ins** for the first week

## Questions?

Common questions your team might ask:

**"What if I break something?"**
- The PR workflow prevents breaking `main`
- They can always create a new branch and start over
- Git tracks everything, so nothing is permanently lost

**"How do I know what to ask Claude?"**
- Start with "I want to..." and describe what they need
- Claude will guide them through the steps
- Refer to `CLAUDE.md` for example commands

**"What if Claude makes a mistake?"**
- Always review code before committing
- The other person reviews PRs before merging
- Production is protected - only merged PRs deploy

**Project Status:** ✅ Ready for handoff!
