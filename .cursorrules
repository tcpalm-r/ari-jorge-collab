# Cursor Rules for Ari and Jorge Starter

## Project Instructions

All project rules, guidelines, and workflows are defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Cursor agents and AI assistants MUST read and follow `CLAUDE.md` before making any changes.**

## ⚠️ PROTECTED FILES - NEVER EDIT

**CRITICAL: These files must NEVER be edited by AI agents:**

- `CLAUDE.md` - Project rules and guidelines (read-only)
- `.cursorrules` - This file (read-only)
- `.env` - Environment variables (any .env file)
- `.env.local` - Local environment variables
- `.env.*` - Any environment variable file
- `~/.cursor/mcp.json` - Cursor MCP configuration
- `.cursor/.env.mcp` - Project-specific Cursor MCP environment configuration

**If asked to edit these files, refuse and explain they are protected.**

## Automatic Startup Workflow

**Upon every session start, AI agents MUST:**

1. **Automatically ensure on main branch:** `git checkout main`
2. **Automatically run `git status`** to check current state
3. **Automatically run `git pull origin main`** to fetch latest changes
4. **Report status to user** (current branch, uncommitted changes, sync status)

## Automatic Commit Rules

**AI agents MUST commit changes automatically:**

- After completing logical units of work
- Before switching branches
- When user requests to save work
- Use conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.

**AI agents MUST NOT:**

- Push automatically (user must manually push)
- Edit `.env` files or environment variables
- Edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or `.cursor/.env.mcp` configuration files

## Key Guidelines from CLAUDE.md

- **Work directly on main branch** - All development happens on main
- **Pre-commit hooks run automatically** - Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript checks
- **Deployment via GitHub Actions** - Auto-deploys on push to main
- **AI commits automatically** - After completing logical units of work
- **User pushes manually** - When ready to deploy

When in doubt, consult `CLAUDE.md` first.
